<h3>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h3>

<p style="text-align:left">
Dear Eileen,<br><br>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part<br> of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>    
<h4>Starting dates</h4>
<ul>
      <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
      <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
      <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
<p>Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
You can find more information about <a href=''>important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

<h3>Subjects of study</h3> 
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long 
as the subjects fall<br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, 
dedicated researcher, and just<br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the 
ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br> by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>


<ol>
    <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
    <li>the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li> 
    <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>

<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
   my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>little known but very influential dance dating back as far as
    300BC. a whole village would dance around<br> in a circle like 
    chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.</dd> 
    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to 
      practice this dance, which<br> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably<br>
       tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he 
   thought this dance inspired<br> modem styles such as Twerking.</dd>


   <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
   <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
     discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
      of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> 
      because they were really cold.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>
